# Building a News Crawler AI Agent with LangChain

## Overview
In this hands-on exercise, you'll create an intelligent agent that crawls major news websites, extracts relevant information, and provides concise summaries using Large Language Models (LLMs). This project will help you understand the practical applications of LangChain for web crawling and content summarization.

## Learning Objectives
- Build a web crawler using LangChain tools
- Implement data extraction from multiple news sources
- Process and clean web content
- Integrate LLMs for text summarization
- Create a coherent output format for summarized news

## Exercise Requirements

### Task 1: Setting Up the Environment
- Set up a new Python project
- Install required dependencies (LangChain, necessary crawling libraries)
- Configure your LLM API keys

### Task 2: News Source Selection
- Select at least 5 major news websites to crawl
- Consider factors like:
  - Website structure
  - Content accessibility
  - Update frequency
  - Geographic diversity

### Task 3: Building the Crawler
- Implement web crawling functionality
- Extract relevant content from news articles
- Handle different HTML structures
- Implement error handling
- Add rate limiting to respect website policies

### Task 4: Content Processing
- Clean extracted text
- Remove advertisements and irrelevant content
- Structure data in a consistent format
- Implement content validation

### Task 5: LLM Integration
- Configure LLM connection
- Design prompts for effective summarization
- Implement summary generation logic
- Ensure consistent output format

### Task 6: Output Generation
- Create a structured format for summaries
- Include source attribution
- Add timestamps
- Format output for easy reading

## Bonus Challenges
1. Implement category classification for news articles
2. Add sentiment analysis
3. Create a simple web interface for the results
4. Implement caching to avoid redundant crawling
5. Add multi-language support

## Tips
- Start with simpler news websites first
- Test your crawler with a single website before scaling
- Pay attention to rate limiting and robots.txt
- Keep summaries concise and informative
- Document your code and design decisions

## Final Notes
This exercise will give you practical experience in combining web crawling with LLM capabilities. Focus on creating a robust and scalable solution that could potentially be used in real-world applications.

Remember to follow ethical web scraping practices and respect website terms of service while implementing your solution.
